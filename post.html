<p> This first post is just short to say I hope you have great day whoever reads this hope you be having great day and that everything goes like you planned.</p> 

<p> I would like to reccomend one of the best horror tv shows I watched recently. </p>

<p> This is horror show that currently has 2 seasons and 3rd one should be released in few weeks by the time of writing this post. </p>
<p> It is movie about people who while traveling get to a place where they can't escape and where monsters are trying to kill them at night and only way to hide is to enter some house or car and use tallisman. Great show 10/10 reccomend everyone It is called From. </p>
<p> I also recomend youtube channel called geekademy who is doing analysis on this show. </p>
