<p1> I don't know what I am doing here. </p1>

<p2> Please Help! </p2>

<p3> Ok just kidding. I made this website for myself to learn and maybe my own blog. Nothing proffesional. 
     But I might sometimes try to implement activity pub.</p3>
<p4> This website will only be written in HTML and maybe CSS so that it can run on anything. </p4>

<p5> Ok now something about me! I am currently 19 year old man, just finnished high school and thinking about going to university. I like Formula 1, linux and anime. I watch horror, sci-fi, comedy tv shows and sometimes movies, but I mostly like tv shows. Currently am writing this on archlinux with gnome desktop enveironment. </p5>
<p6> I wish to write here some apps reccomendations for both linux and android. Some photos I take with phone (maybe?) and I don't know what else honestly. </p6>
